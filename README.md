# Machine-vise-CATIA-Project
🔧 Project Description

This project presents the full design of a Machine Vice using CATIA V5, starting from 2D engineering sketches and ending with a complete 3D assembly and technical drawings.
The project demonstrates practical use of CATIA tools in Part Design, Assembly Design, and Drafting, covering every step required to turn a mechanical drawing into a manufacturable product.

The work includes 3D modeling of all parts, applying constraints, assembling the mechanism, generating 2D technical drawings, and adding engineering details such as tolerances, fits, and surface roughness.

📘 CATIA Tools & Features Used
🟦 1. Sketcher Workbench

Used to create all 2D profiles for components, including:

Constraints (dimensional & geometrical)

Projection and construction lines

Mirroring, patterning, trimming, and fillet tools

Fully constrained sketches for accuracy

🟩 2. Part Design Workbench

Used to convert sketches into 3D parts using:

Pad & Pocket

Shaft (Revolve)

Groove

Hole (standard threads, countersinks, counterbores)

Fillets & Chamfers

Rib & Slot features

Boolean operations (Add, Remove, Intersect)

These tools were used to model components such as:

Fixed Jaw

Movable Jaw

Main Screw

Nut Block

Gripping Strips

Round Nut

Locking Nut

🟧 3. Assembly Design Workbench

Used to assemble all CATParts into a complete machine vice:

Insert components

Fix the base part

Apply constraints:

Coincidence

Contact

Offset

Angle

Axis-to-axis alignment

Kinematic relation for screw & jaw motion

This allowed creation of a functioning mechanism where rotating the screw moves the movable jaw.

🟪 4. Drafting Workbench (2D Drawings)

Generated manufacturing drawings from 3D models using:

Front / Top / Side views

Section views (full & half sections)

Detailed views for threads and fits

Auxiliary views

Title block creation

Bill of materials (BOM)

Balloons and part numbering

📐 Engineering Annotations Added
Dimensional Tolerances

Applied on:

Holes

Slots

Critical lengths

Jaw faces

Geometrical Tolerances (GD&T)

Included:

Parallelism

Perpendicularity

Position tolerance

Circular runout for the screw shaft

Surface Roughness

Ra 1.6 µm for sliding surfaces

Ra 3.2 µm for machined faces

Ra 6.3 µm for cast parts

Fits

Hole–shaft fits (e.g., H7/g6)

Clearance fits for screw rotation

Tight fits for assembly locking areas
