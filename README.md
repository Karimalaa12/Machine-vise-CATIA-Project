🔧 Project Description
This project presents the full design of a Machine Vice using CATIA V5, starting from 2D engineering sketches and ending with a complete 3D assembly and technical drawings.
The project demonstrates practical use of CATIA tools in Part Design, Assembly Design, and Drafting, covering every step required to turn a mechanical drawing into a manufacturable product.
The work includes 3D modeling of all parts, applying constraints, assembling the mechanism, generating 2D technical drawings, and adding engineering details such as tolerances, fits, and surface roughness.

📘 CATIA Tools & Features Used
🟦 1. Sketcher Workbench
Used to create all 2D profiles for components, including:
•	Constraints (dimensional & geometrical)
•	Projection and construction lines
•	Mirroring, patterning, trimming, and fillet tools
•	Fully constrained sketches for accuracy

🟩 2. Part Design Workbench
Used to convert sketches into 3D parts using:
•	Pad & Pocket
•	Shaft (Revolve)
•	Groove
•	Hole (standard threads, countersinks, counterbores)
•	Fillets & Chamfers
•	Rib & Slot features
•	Boolean operations (Add, Remove, Intersect)
These tools were used to model components such as:
•	Fixed Jaw
•	Movable Jaw
•	Main Screw
•	Nut Block
•	Gripping Strips
•	Round Nut
•	Locking Nut

🟧 3. Assembly Design Workbench
Used to assemble all CATParts into a complete machine vice:
•	Insert components
•	Fix the base part
•	Apply constraints:
o	Coincidence
o	Contact
o	Offset
o	Angle
o	Axis-to-axis alignment
•	Kinematic relation for screw & jaw motion
This allowed creation of a functioning mechanism where rotating the screw moves the movable jaw.

🟪 4. Drafting Workbench (2D Drawings)
Generated manufacturing drawings from 3D models using:
•	Front / Top / Side views
•	Section views (full & half sections)
•	Detailed views for threads and fits
•	Auxiliary views
•	Title block creation
•	Bill of materials (BOM)
•	Balloons and part numbering

📐 Engineering Annotations Added
Dimensional Tolerances
Applied on:
•	Holes
•	Slots
•	Critical lengths
•	Jaw faces
Geometrical Tolerances (GD&T)
Included:
•	Parallelism
•	Perpendicularity
•	Position tolerance
•	Circular runout for the screw shaft
Surface Roughness
•	Ra 1.6 µm for sliding surfaces
•	Ra 3.2 µm for machined faces
•	Ra 6.3 µm for cast parts
Fits
•	Hole–shaft fits (e.g., H7/g6)
•	Clearance fits for screw rotation
•	Tight fits for assembly locking areas
